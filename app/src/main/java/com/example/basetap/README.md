Welcome! This is the repo for what I am calling BaseTap, a Star Wars Unlimited life tracking app. This is obviously inspired by LifeTap, made for Magic the Gathering by Michael Bourkas.

Conventions:

- Player layouts have their own xPlayerLayouts.kt file to store layout data and and their own xPlayerComponents.kt. Global components are currently stored in FourPlayerComponents.kt but this may be changed in the future.
